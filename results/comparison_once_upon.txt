If all those increases come back, as they did in 2009-2010, it might actually be a reduction in money in consumers\' pockets," Leipzig told AlterNet.\n\nThe result? In the short term, it\'s more people in jobs with lower wages, and, ultimately, a larger public sector, that must cover the cost of the increases in public employees\' salaries.\n\n"[The unions] have a strategy which involves increasing the cost of labor, and they\'ve been successful with that for a decade or so," said Leipzig.\n\nMany Americans have been forced by these price hikes to reduce their spending, a phenomenon that makes it more difficult for people to get out of debt.\n\n"The main reason you had consumers take out more'}

We lived in one of the "rural" areas with lots of children. Our father, who was not in the habit of asking people who had never had sexual experience, even a single one, to take their clothes off for him, did not know the meaning of "sexual etiquette", especially not when a woman\'s genitals were exposed to him.

More than a few people, in fact, have publicly condemned the fact that more men than women are seeking attention, becoming celebrities, selling books, trying out careers, etc. And this fear is not based on sexism—many women have gone on to successfully and happily pursue careers and positions in industries where the majority of the population doesn't want them to have them—but is rather fear of becoming a target for a man's emotional and psychological aggression.\n\nAnd it isn't new."}

While you can purchase a bottle of it now, the only place you can purchase it is at your favorite gas station.\n\nIt\'s pretty sweet, too!\n\nWhat\'s really unique about Ritzy is not the type of carbonation it contains but the process by which it\'s extracted.

GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time, there was an organization called The Society for Creative Anachronism. They were a group of writers, scientists, and artists with a common goal: to create works of time travel, either through the use of technology and/or an application of a science known as "archaeology." The Society had a number of founding members: Alan Lomax, the first director of the Carnegie Institution for Science; Arthur D. Thackeray, author of the novel I Remember Mama; Robert Heinlein, best-selling author of Starship Troopers; and Charles Fort, the historian and author of The Great Fire of London.\n\nThe Society was one of, if not the most famous and influential group of creatives in a certain period of time. They made quite a few media appearances, published many books and journals, and got together many times to get together and brainstorm time travel. One of their best-known projects was to create an illustrated chronologically ordered "chronical of the human race" in the style of the Olde English Chronicles (such as Beowulf) and the Chronicles of Narnia. They began publishing the work in the late 1950s and continued their efforts to create accurate books or journals of time travel for decades.'}

Then he would tell them, and then I would spend the whole afternoon telling my cousin my dirty jokes on a train ride home.\n\nAnyway, one summer my cousin invited me and my brother out to his old house.

In fact, if one was to look at her family\'s fortune, the situation of the family\'s finances would have left one in awe! Her mother, who owned a successful inn, sold all of its assets, all of its land, and left her a single daughter, Cherrytree, who had no land at all. On top of that, she had lost her inheritance to the point where the money of Cherrytree\'s father went to her head.\n\nAnd she was one of the most beloved of girls in the entire place. As expected, the maids who went to work at the inn day in and day out did their utmost to make her feel at ease within their hearts, but that was all that they could do. When they brought Cherrytree home from work, the girl would always look at her mother, and the maids would always bring her food without a care in the world.

The first one was led by the New York Times that suggested that the Clinton Foundation had taken money from foreign governments through her family\'s philanthropic efforts, and it focused heavily on Clinton\'s dealings in China, among other countries. The second one was led by a congressional committee and was focused on the Clinton Foundation\'s work with other countries with "pay-to-play" political arrangements and financial incentives from governments.

GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time, there was an old story the likes of which we cannot imagine. No one was really sure how it got on, or why it came from back then. In the beginning, one of the best known characters in the story was named "Tom," and people called him The Tom. Now, the story was long ago forgotten, and the names are no more; but the tale is not forgotten; indeed, it shows only how people could forget something and be so certain of their belief in a thing as to be entirely confident that the old story is true.\n\n\nThe Tom was an engineer employed by the railroad to inspect all the carriages of the company. One day, while looking at one of the carriages, he saw two young men standing beside it. He recognized the fellow as being one of his own sons--the Tom\'s oldest son. He stopped his work and asked the young fellows what they wanted. To Tom\'s astonishment, the two men told him they had found a piece of old railroad track, that it had fallen in the ground, and was broken up into gravel and gravel stone by the trains. The Tom could have laughed, if it had not been so serious; and though the two young men begged his pardon and offered'}


GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time, the word "grief" was synonymous with "emotional pain". We know, though, that in this field, the difference between "emotional pain" and "grief" was an artificial one. The grief that actually existed in ancient China was called "shuang ming", and is also seen in the "Five Elements", or as the Taoists say, the five mental states called "shuang." It means, "The emotion of woe and sorrow, so longing," or, "The emotion of the heart, sorrow and lamentation".\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese concept of wu-tian was based on mental states. Although it is not clear whether the word that was used by Buddhist monks is the original usage of the word, in the "Shuo wu-tao" of the Sixth or Eighth century, a poem by the legendary writer of the "History of Chu" Huineng, the poet says that shuang ming refers to "mental emotions." Thus, it would appear that the ancient concept of wu-tian was not simply emotion and pain, but an emotional response. We must keep in mind, because this is not easy to explain, that the emotion of a grief'}

GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time the U.S. was viewed as the global leader in medical innovation. It was home to medical centers like Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, Brown and Cornell Universities, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford oncology, and Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center. But in the past decade, as medical research institutions have been struggling to meet patient needs, U.S. healthcare spending per available capita has increased by 17 percent compared to other wealthy countries, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and that rate hasn\'t picked up in the past five years. With the recent rise of a number of new and emerging biologic treatments for disease, such as the combination of cancer drugs methotrexate and carboplatin, the United States has become somewhat of a laughingstock in the medical world. One reason for that, say experts, is a reliance on an unproven cancer treatment called "primary radical mastectomy," as described in this recent ABC News story. The method, which has largely been abandoned in Europe, is being touted as the most effective approach for patients with cancer. While there is no doubt that it does treat cancer, the method relies on the removal of a portion of the breast. The problem? Unlike other surgeries — like'}

GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time" a large percentage of women in the United States were married. Today, about 40% are — which means they should be able to count the years before their nuptials as years spent on maternity leave, which, as my colleague Ann Friedman points out, seems to be a fairly typical "unearned" benefit.\n\n"Unearned?" "Unbelievable"? Well, you might, but since when has the United States ever been known for treating men and women equally? The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world that does not mandate paid maternity leave, even as most other advanced democracies have done just that. And yet it\'s often been suggested as a good idea that would allow for women to spend longer in the workforce.\n\nYes, there are some exceptions: a lot of Americans don\'t have children until after they are in their 40s. But in general, women have less than one year of leave after giving birth, and in fact it takes at least nine months (if not longer) before they can even receive paid leave to care for a new child, and the last time my daughters were born, I had to have unpaid leave.\n\nSo why would a lot of American women want more maternity'}

GPT2-XL:  'Once upon a time in this country this was an acceptable position, the only justification for the status quo of oppression and subjugation upon the poor and powerless. Since then the conditions we confront today, in the U.S., are so different that today, rather than saying "the rich should pay for things the poor can\'t pay for" we say, "the poor should pay for things the rich won\'t pay for." The first of the two is just as unacceptable and just as silly. I have said before that I don\'t consider it an exaggeration when I say I feel that my own position is almost as silly.\n\nWe have all been told that taxes are a form of wealth transfer. But, you can only transfer wealth that\'s actually there. The wealth of the rich is not there, not in the form of real assets, not in the form of an actual physical asset: it\'s in the form of economic assets—money—that can be held as accounts for other real assets. So, in the form of wealth that exists, taxes do more than transfer it, tax it, transfer it, give it to the government. After all, that\'s their job. That\'s what they get paid for. They only get paid for that in the end'}

Now, it works to help countries who "have" terrorism and "have" terrorists.\n\nSince the time of the Cold War, Washington\'s foreign policy was based on the notion that, however bad the foreign problem, the US could use its "soft power" to "negotiate" a solution and thereby "clean" itself up. This was the "Washington Consensus" about foreign policy – that is, if the world was not evil, then US power would be safe.\n\nBut the Obama administration has reversed the Washington Consensus and taken steps that have helped turn the US into the world\'s largest pariah. The evidence of the new foreign policy is the way the United States has, to put it mildly, acted since the election of Donald Trump.
